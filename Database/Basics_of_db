Data Base:
    - Collection of data stored in a place is called Data Base.

Data Base Management System (DBMS):
    - A software that helps users to create and maintain a database.
CRUD:
    - Create Read/Retrieve Update and Delete data 

Two Types of DataBases:
Relational Database:
    - SQL
    - Storing and Organising the data in the form of tables.
    - Each table has column and rows.
    - Unique key identifiers for each row.

Non Relational Database:
    - NoSql / not just SQL
    - storing and Organising data into anything but a tradional table
    - Key value store
    - Documents (JSON. etc)
    - Graphs
    - Flexible tables

Inorder to maintain these data of relational data base we have:
    - Relational DataBase Management System
        - mySql, Oracle, postgreSQL, etc.

Structered Query Language(SQL):
    - a language to interact with rdbms
    - used to perform C.R.U.D operaions
    - sql code used in one RDBMS cannot be used in another without modification.

Primary Key:
    - a key which Uniquely identifies each row.
    - which has no mapping to the real world
Natural Key:
    - a key which has mapping to the real world - ssn
Foreign Key:
    - a foreign key is just a primary key of another table
    - where the foreign key acts as a bridge to connect the two tables
    - it allows us to link different relationships
Composite Key:
    - a primary consists of two columns
    - a key where it needs two attributes
    - sometimes there's a probability of creating two primary keys with two foreign keys.
        inorder to connect and maintain the relationship with the tables and to help with the data.

SQL BASICS:
    - Sql is basically a hybrid language, it has 4 types in it.
    - Data Query Language (DQL):
        - Used to query the database for information.
        - Get information that is already stored there.
    - Data Definition Language (DDL):
        - Used for defining database schemas.
    - Data Control Language (DCL):
        - Used for controlling access to the data in the database.
        - User & permissions Management.
    - Data Manipulation Language (DML):
        - Used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the DB.
Query:
    - is a set of instructions given to RDBMS.
