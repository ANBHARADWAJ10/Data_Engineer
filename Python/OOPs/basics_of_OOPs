Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)
    - is a programming paradigm that structures code around objects rather than functions or logic 
    and it aims to model real world entities.

Oops revolves around these concepts:
class
object
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Data Abstraction

class - class is blue print which has set of attributes and methods.
object - is an instance of a class so it can access all the attributes and methods of the class.
        and the object consists of its state, behavior and identity.

example:

class Dog:
    species = "canine"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

d1 = Dog('max', 5)
d2 = Dog('ron', 6)

Here, the we have created an dog object with the help of dog class

Self - this parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class.
        it allows us to access the attributes and the methods of the object.

__init__ - is a constructor and it is automatically called when an object is created. 
            it initializes the attributes of the class.


so here when we print the object directly like

print(d1) it prints something like this <__main__.Dog object at 0x0000014EAFA16A50>

to avoid that we have a constructor to do that.

def __str__(self):
    return f"{name} {age}"
