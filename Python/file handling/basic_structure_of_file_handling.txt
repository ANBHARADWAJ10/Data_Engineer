Using Open()

handle = open(filename, mode)

returns a handle use to manipulate the file

filename - string
mode is optional and should be 
    - 'r' if we are planning to read the file
    - 'w' if we are planning to write the file

default mode - read (r)

if the file is does not exist you get an exception error
    - FileNotFoundError

File handle as a sequence

xfile = open('newFile.txt')
for data in xfile:
    print(data)

count lines in the file
count = 0
for data in xfile:
    count += 1
print(count)

read the whole file but it prints all the lines in a single string.

xfile = open('newFile.txt')
readfile = xfile.read()
print(len(readfile)) // takes the length of the characters available in the file.
print(readfile[:20]) // prints in single line but takes only the first 20 characters


print the selected line you want

xfile.seek(0)
print(xfile.readline().strip()) // readline - reads the line and strip cuts the string from the remaining lines.

line that starts from the word a selected word  (works only if the line starts with it)
But this prints all the line with the extra spaces 


xfile.seek(0)  # reset the file pointer to the beginning
lines = xfile.readlines()
for line in lines:
    if line.startswith('mode'):
        print('line:', line.strip())
