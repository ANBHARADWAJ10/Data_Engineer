# for loops are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.
# They are often used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

# Example: Print each character in a string
name = "Nikhil"
print(len(name))

for char in name:
    print("Character:", char, end=" ")
