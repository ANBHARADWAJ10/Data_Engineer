Type Casting are of two types in python

Implicit and Explicit

Implicit - is nothing but the python itself converts the data into the required datatype according out input or the assigned data

Explicit - We convert the data according to our needs

int() - can be used to convert something into a integer. ( but the value has to be a numerical value).
float() - can be used to convert something into a float. ( but the value has to be a numerical value).
str() - can be used to convert anythin into string.
