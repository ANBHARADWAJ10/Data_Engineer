The built-in zip is useful when you want to put two lists up beside each other and loop over them element by element in pairs.

# Define a list of circle diameters
diameters = [10, 12, 16, 20, 25]                    

# Compute circle area by list comprehension
areas = [3.14 * (d/2)**2 for d in diameters]

# Print (diameter, area) pairs
for d, a in zip(diameters, areas):
    print(d, a)
