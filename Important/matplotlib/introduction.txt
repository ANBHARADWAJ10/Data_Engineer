Plotting with matplotlib

matplotlib is most widely used plotting library.

So, it has to be installed separately before we can import it and use it.

# (Note: This line is not needed when using an editor)   

%matplotlib inline  

Given a list of data for x and y, a line graph can be produced in a single command plt.plot(x,y), while actually showing the plot has its own command.

It might seem wierd that the plt.show() is needed,
 but it is not always desired to have the plot shown.
  Sometimes it is desired to produce the graph and have it saved to a png-file or do something else with it instead of showing it. For more complex plots there might be many different plotting commands to build the plot
, but only a single showing command is needed at the end.

Customization of graphs

The plot of 
 from above can be made much nicer by a little customization. 
 f(x) = x**2
 The command names should make the code self-explanatory.
